-- Have a baseline pytorch model for depth >> Done  (Improvement to be done by Arunava and Hirunima)
-- Boilerplate Code >> WIP
-- Write code for WPNet >> WIP
-- Train steps
	First try with depth model freezed
	Then try with few layers unfreezed 

-- Try Image stacking -- multiple frames
-- Depth + Semantic ??
-- Frame stacking wrapper - how to stack the frames ?
