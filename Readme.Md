-- Have a baseline pytorch model for depth >> Done  

-- System Design and Boilerplate Code >> WIP
	
		a) Image load function >> Done

-- Write code for WPNet >> WIP

		a) Architecture code  >> Done

-- Train steps
	First try with depth model freezed
	Then try with few layers unfreezed 

-- Try Image stacking -- multiple frames

-- Depth + Semantic ??

-- Frame stacking wrapper - how to stack the frames ?
