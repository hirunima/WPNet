-- Have a baseline pytorch model for depth >> Done  (Improvement to be done by Arunava and Hirunima)

-- Boilerplate Code >> WIP
	
	a) Image load function >> Done

-- Write code for WPNet >> WIP

-- Train steps
	First try with depth model freezed
	Then try with few layers unfreezed 

-- Try Image stacking -- multiple frames

-- Depth + Semantic ??

-- Frame stacking wrapper - how to stack the frames ?
